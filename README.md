### About me

- 📚 By night 🎮🎵📺 Learning whole my life... No space for boredom 🤓 various private software or hardware related projects, nothing for public repo just yet.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning C#, didn't need it in years.

Python, C#, C++, Kotlin, PHP, HTML, Tailwind, Typescript, ... or help out a acquintances & friends at their side hustles, problem solving for web / game development or software.
