### Hello adventurer 👋

### About me

- 👩‍💻 By day working in game studio in Tools & pipeline department as senior QA engineer.
- 📚 By night or any free time I'm 🎮🎵📺 learning whole my life... No space for boredom 🤓
  - various private software, automation scripts or hardware related projects, most of it couldn't publish due to dependencies that are licensed but got few things coming up by end of 2024 🤞.
  - I love spending time with my closest circle, walks on the beach or countryside or blend into the crowds whether is that in cities and once in a while conferences.
- 🌱 In my free time I switch between various
  - projects - diving into C++ and game dev projects, from a different angle I am used to at my work
  - attending courses - where I either want to refresh knowledge I don't actively use and I'll need it soon again or dive into something new. Recently finished one on unit testing, personal knowledge management and Unreal Engine automation
  - C# or Python is something I take particular course or article on topic I want to utilize knowledge upon. I tried 100 days type of courses twice but I didn't feel I took away much of that as two thirds I'd not end up utilizing in a quarter for example, so I enroll and take parts I know I can utilize in present and then return to sections I'd need at later time.
  - exploring different software or games and providing feedback when one asks for it. I been more on tooling side in 2024 compare to games, it usually all balances out by end of the year 😁
- 👯 Past two years I made time to figure out the flow of #Hacktober fest and what kind of repositories I want to stick around to. Looking forward to upcoming #Hacktoberfest where I'd contribute more than just documentation and broken links and yes if time permits me I do that oustide of the that month to but more maintaining type of submits.
  - In general enjoying chatter with like minded devs and hoping to contribute more to open source projects that include any type of scripting or programming.
  - ... or help out a acquintances & friends at their learning projects, problem solving for web / game development or software.
    - Python, C#, C++, Kotlin, PHP, HTML, Tailwind, Typescript, 
- ⚡ Fun facts:
  - I used to web develop, compete & coach in esports before I got into game industry and software development. I still return to web projects whenever time permits me and curiosity wants to keep up with all the stack news and upgrades 😊 or consult if one would come over with esports related question and follow all the major events whenever I can.
  - I enjoy writing technical documentation and user guides, my work is my hobby - I think that's the one people have difficult time understanding.
  - I don't really attend many social gatherups, so when I do it's special 😆
  - I love humor or anything that produces healthy, positively charged laughter. We also get amused by all the misconceptions some people build about me 😂
