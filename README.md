### Hello adventurer 👋

### About me

- 👩‍💻 By day Tools & pipeline QA engineer in game studio.
- 📚 By night 🎮🎵📺 Learning whole my life... No space for boredom 🤓 various private software or hardware related projects, most of it couldn't publish due to dependencies that are licensed but got few things coming up for 2024.
- 🌱 In my free time I’m currently diving into C++ and game dev projects, from a different angle I am used to at my work.
- 👯 Every year I make time and look forward to collaborate on open source projects that envolve any type of scripting or programming. Python, C#, C++, Kotlin, PHP, HTML, Tailwind, Typescript, ... or help out a acquintances & friends at their side hustles, problem solving for web / game development or software.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to web develop and compete in e-sports before I got into game industry and software development. I still return to web projects whenever time permits me and curiosity wants to keep up with all the stack news and upgrades 😊
