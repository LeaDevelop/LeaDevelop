### About me

- 👩‍💻 By day Tools & pipeline QA engineer in game studio.
- 📚 By night 🎮🎵📺 Learning whole my life... No space for boredom 🤓 various private software or hardware related projects, nothing for public repo just yet.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning C#, didn't need it in years.
- 👯 Every year I make time and look forward to collaborate on open source projects that envolve scripting or Python, C#, Kotlin, PHP or help out a acquintances or friends whether is that problem solving or GitHub adventures.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to web develop and compete in e-sports before I got into game industry and software development. I still return to web projects whenever time permits me and curiosity wants to keep up with all the stack news and upgrades 😊
